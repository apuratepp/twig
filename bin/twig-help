twig-help
=========

Provides help for Twig and its subcommands.

Synopsis
--------

  twig help [<subcommand>]

Description
-----------

  Shows help content for Twig and for its built-in subcommands.

  To make a custom subcommand work with this system (e.g.,
  `twig help my-subcommand`), simply add `--help` support to the subcommand
  (e.g., `twig my-subcommand --help`), and Twig will call it automatically.

Examples
--------

  Show help content for Twig:

    twig help

  Show help content for a Twig subcommand, e.g., `twig-rebase`:

    twig help rebase

Subcommand for Twig: <http://rondevera.github.io/twig/>
Author: Ron DeVera <http://rondevera.com>

  HELP
end

args = ARGV.dup

if args.include?('--help')
  puts help_content
  exit
end

subcommand = args[0] || ''

# If no subcommand was given, default to `twig --help`
exec("twig #{subcommand} --help")
