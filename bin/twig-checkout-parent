twig-checkout-parent
====================

Checks out a branch's parent branch.

Synopsis
--------

  twig checkout-parent [-b|--branch <branch>]

Description
-----------

  Checks out the current branch's parent branch, if any, based on the current
  branch's `diff-branch` property.

  You can use this with `twig checkout-child` to traverse your tree of branches.

Options
-------

  `-b` or `--branch`: Checks out the parent branch of the given branch, rather
  than the current branch.
