# Synopsis:
#
#   twig checkout-parent [-b|--branch <branch>]
#
# Description:
#
#   Checks out the current branch's parent branch, if any, based on the current
#   branch's `diff-branch` property.
#
#   You can use this with `twig checkout-child` to traverse your tree of
#   branches.
#
# Options:
#
#   `-b` or `--branch`: Checks out the parent branch of the given branch, rather
#   than the current branch.
#
# Subcommand for Twig: <http://rondevera.github.io/twig/>
