# Synopsis:
#
# - `twig checkout-child [-b|--branch <branch>]`
#
# Usage:
#
# - `twig checkout-child`:
#   Checks out the current branch's child branch, if any, based on the child's
#   `diff-branch` property. If the current branch has multiple child branches,
#   this subcommand lists all of them and prompts for a selection.
#
# - `twig checkout-child -b <branch>`:
#   Checks out the given branch's child branch, if any, based on the child's
#   `diff-branch` property.
#
# You can use this with `twig checkout-parent` to traverse your tree of
# branches.
#
# Subcommand for Twig: <http://rondevera.github.io/twig/>
